# FEX-Emu (x86 -> AArch64 JIT). Built only when the FEX backend is enabled (ARM64 Linux/Darwin/Android/iOS +
# Clang, resolved at the top level). FEX is not designed to be embedded via add_subdirectory: it
# assumes it is the top-level project (~60 uses of CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR) and configures its whole
# loader/tools tree. Instead build it standalone via ExternalProject and consume the resulting
# self-contained shared FEXCore library (the FEXCore_shared target). Only that target is built -
# not the FEX tools. iOS allows no shared libraries outside the app bundle, so there the static
# FEXCore archive is consumed instead, together with the static archives it depends on.
